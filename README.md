# substrate-tip-bot

> A GitHub App built with [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that can submit tips on behalf
> of a [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) based network.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start

### ENV File

To use this bot, you need to have a proper `.env` file created. Most of the options will
automatically be generated by the GitHub application creation process, but you will also need to add
`ACCOUNT_SEED` and `ALLOWED_USERS`:

Example `.env` file:

```
WEBHOOK_PROXY_URL=https://smee.io/<secret>
APP_ID=<id>
PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n  private key \n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
WEBHOOK_SECRET=<secret>
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=<id>
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=<secret>
ACCOUNT_SEED="twelve words seperated by spaces which seeds the account controlled by bot"
ALLOWED_USERS=["shawntabrizi", "and", "other", "github", "usernames", "in", "an", "array"]
```

## Docker

```sh
# 1. Build container
docker build -t substrate-tip-bot .

# 2. Start container
docker run -e APP_ID=<app-id> -e PRIVATE_KEY=<pem-value> substrate-tip-bot
```
